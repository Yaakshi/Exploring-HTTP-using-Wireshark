## 4. Finally, let’s try visiting a website that is password-protected and examining the sequence of HTTP messages exchanged for such a site.
The URL http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/protected_pages/HTTP-wireshark-file5.html is password protected. 

The username is “Wireshark-students” (without the quotes), and the password is “network” (again, without the quotes).
So, let’s access this “secure” password-protected site.

## Do the following:

1. Make sure your browser’s cache is cleared, as discussed above, and close your browser. Then, start up your browser
2. Start up the Wireshark packet sniffer
3. Enter the following URL into your browser http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/protected_pages/HTTP-wiresharkfile5.html Type the requested username and password into the pop-up box.
4. Stop Wireshark packet capture and enter “http” in the display-filter-specification window, so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed later in the packet-listing window.

## Answer the following questions:

### 1. What is the server’s response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?

### ```To the initial GET request, the server responded with a 401 [Unauthorised] status code.```

### 2. When your browser sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what new field is included in the HTTP GET message?

### ```Authorization field is included in the second HTTP GET request.```
It contained the username and password credentials being sent to the server.
