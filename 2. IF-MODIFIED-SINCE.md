## 2. Before performing the steps below, ensure your browser’s cache is empty.

1. Start up your web browser, and make sure your browser’s cache is cleared, as discussed above.
2. Start up the Wireshark packet sniffer
3. Enter the following URL into your browser
http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file2.html
Your browser should display a very simple five-line HTML file.
4. Quickly enter the same URL into your browser again (or simply select the refresh button on your browser)
5. Stop Wireshark packet capture and enter “http” in the display-filter-specification window, so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed later in the packet-listing window.

## Answer the following questions:

### 1. Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE” line in the HTTP GET?

### ```There is no if-modified-since header in the HTTP GET request.```

### 2. Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? How can you tell?

We can see that the HTML code of the webpage is also displayed along with the headers in the packet-listing window.
### ```The server has explicitly returned the contents of the file.```

### 3. Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” line in the HTTP GET? What information follows the “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” header?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3deb95e6-6f51-46a1-934c-ab801cf11c08)
We can now see the if-modified-since header in the second GET request.
### ```If-Modified-Since: Tue, 06 Aug 2024 05:59:01 GMT\r\n```

### 4. What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned from the server in response to this second HTTP GET? Did the server explicitly return the file’s contents? Explain.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0ad97e1-561d-455b-991f-d2d0aa0f90e8)
### ```Status code and descriptor for the second response is 304 [Not Modified].```
### ```This time, the file did not explicitly return the contents of the file.```
