## 1. Let’s begin our exploration of HTTP by downloading a very simple HTML file - one that is very short and contains no embedded objects. Do the following:

1. Start up your web browser.
2. Start the Wireshark packet sniffer, as described in the Introductory lab (but don’t yet begin packet capture). Enter “http” (just the letters, not the quotation marks) in the display-filter-specification window, so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed later in the packet-listing window. (We’re only interested in the HTTP protocol here, and don’t want to see the clutter of all captured packets).
3. Wait more than one minute (we’ll see why shortly), and then begin Wireshark packet capture.
4. Enter the following into your browser
```http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html```
Your browser should display a very simple, one-line HTML file.
5. Stop Wireshark packet capture.

## By looking at the information in the HTTP GET and response messages, answer the following questions.

### 1. Is your browser running HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1? What version of HTTP is the server running?

By analysing the HTTP request, we can identify the version of HTTP used on our local system.
### ```My browser is running HTTP version 1.1.```

By analysing the HTTP response, we can identify the version of HTTP used on the server side.
### ```The server is running HTTP version 1.1.```

### 2. What languages (if any) do your browser indicate that it can accept to the server?

By analysing the HTTP request, we can identify the encoding and language that my browser can accept from the server.
### ```Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\n```
### ```Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\r\n```
### ```My browser accepts English (United States) responses.```

### 3. What is the IP address of your computer? What is the IP address of the gaia.cs.umass.edu server?

By analysing either the request or the response packet, under the network layer – Internet protocol, we can find the source and destination IP addresses.
### ```IP address of my computer is 10.11.132.117.```
### ```IP address of the gaia.cs.unmass.edu server is 128.119.245.12```

### 4. What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90a36353-9e95-4f4c-8ec3-6649bb00a224)
Under application layer where HTTP response is unwrapped, we can see the status code and its descriptor.
### ```The status code of the response is 200 [OK].```

### 5. When was the HTML file that you are retrieving last modified at the server?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5df1f29-e890-4d5a-a7b9-0dfa714376f5)
The if-modified-since is a GET request header. To determine when a HTML file was last modified, we need to identify the if-modified-since header under HTTP.
### ```There is no if-modified-since header in the request packet.```

### 6. How many bytes of content are being returned to your browser?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/009b90e2-63fb-4d19-bcd0-603d02894311)
### ```128 bytes of content are returned from server to the browser.```

### 7. By inspecting the raw data in the packet content window, do you see any headers within the data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window? If so, name one.

### ```All the headers in the raw data are also displayed in the packet-listing window.```
